# DRY Principle and Method Grouping

## What is the DRY Principle?

The DRY principle, standing for "Don't Repeat Yourself," is a fundamental software development principle aimed at reducing redundancy and promoting code reusability within a codebase. The principle advocates for the elimination of duplicated logic or knowledge by ensuring that every piece of functionality or information within a system has a single, unambiguous representation.

## How does Method Grouping Help Adhere to the DRY Principle?

Method grouping involves consolidating similar tasks or functionalities into reusable methods or functions. By doing so, it eliminates redundancy by ensuring that the same logic or operations are not repeated across multiple places within your codebase. Instead, the logic is encapsulated in a single method and invoked wherever the functionality is needed.

## Example Scenario:

Consider a scenario in a JavaScript application where you need to perform a series of calculations based on user input. Instead of duplicating the calculation logic in various parts of your code, you can create a separate function to handle these calculations. This function can then be called from different components or modules, promoting code reuse and adhering to the DRY principle.

## Benefits of Method Grouping:

1. **Code Reusability**: Grouping similar tasks into a single method promotes code reusability. Once a method is defined, it can be called from multiple places within the application without duplicating the underlying logic.
2. **Maintainability**: With logic centralized in a single method, any updates or modifications only need to be made in one place. This makes the codebase easier to maintain and reduces the risk of introducing bugs due to inconsistencies.
3. **Readability**: By abstracting complex logic into well-named methods, the overall readability of the code improves. Developers can quickly understand the purpose of each method and its role within the application.

## Conclusion:

Adhering to the DRY principle through method grouping promotes cleaner, more maintainable, and readable code. By consolidating similar tasks into reusable methods, developers can reduce redundancy, improve code consistency, and enhance overall software quality.
